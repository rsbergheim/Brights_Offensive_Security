## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this security review is to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the web application brights.sana.ai. This review was conducted over a period of 2 hours with the aim of discovering flaws that could be exploited by malicious actors.

## 2. Scope
The scope of this security review includes:
- Testing the application as an unauthenticated user.
- Testing the application as an authenticated regular user.
- Testing the application as an authenticated administrator.

## 3. Methodology
The following methodology was used for the security review:
- Manual exploration of the web application.
- Automated scanning using tools such as OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite.
- Exploitation of identified vulnerabilities to confirm their impact.

## 4. Initial Analysis
The initial analysis involved the following steps and tools:

### Port Scanning
Tool: **nmap**

bash:
nmap -sS -Pn brights.sana.ai

Findings:

    Open Ports: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)
    Potential services running on these ports were identified.

### Directory and File Enumeration

Tool: gobuster

bash

gobuster dir -u https://brights.sana.ai -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

Findings:

    Discovered directories: /admin, /login, /api

### HTTP Headers Analysis

Tool: securityheaders.com

Findings:

    Missing security headers: Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options
    Recommendations provided to implement missing headers for improved security.

### SSL/TLS Configuration Analysis

Tool: SSL Labs SSL Test

Findings:

    SSL/TLS configuration received an A rating.
    Issues: Weak ciphers supported, no HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header.

These initial findings provided a baseline understanding of the security posture of the page, guiding further detailed assessments.

## 5. Findings

### Unauthenticated

**1. Sensitive Information Exposure**
- **Description:** Sensitive data was found exposed in the source code, including API keys and server configurations.
- **Impact:** Attackers could use this information to perform further attacks on the application or the server.
- **Recommendation:** Remove sensitive information from the client-side source code and store it securely on the server.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Description:** Reflected XSS vulnerability was identified in the search functionality.
- **Impact:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of another user's browser session.
- **Recommendation:** Implement proper input validation and output encoding to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.

### Authenticated as Regular User

**3. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**
- **Description:** Regular users can access and modify other users' data by changing the user ID in the URL.
- **Impact:** This could lead to unauthorized data access and modification.
- **Recommendation:** Implement proper access controls and validate user permissions before granting access to resources.

**4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- **Description:** The application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, allowing malicious actors to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact:** This could result in unauthorized actions being performed without the user's knowledge.
- **Recommendation:** Implement anti-CSRF tokens in forms and verify them on the server side.

### Authenticated as Administrator

**5. Privilege Escalation**
- **Description:** Regular users can escalate their privileges to that of an administrator through specific API endpoints.
- **Impact:** This allows unauthorized users to gain administrative access and control over the application.
- **Recommendation:** Enforce strict access control checks and audit all administrative actions.

**6. SQL Injection**
- **Description:** SQL Injection vulnerability was identified in the user management module.
- **Impact:** This could allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data leakage, modification, or deletion.
- **Recommendation:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection attacks.

## 6. Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are provided to enhance the security posture of brights.sana.ai:
- Regularly review and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Implement comprehensive access control mechanisms to ensure users can only access resources they are authorized for.
- Use secure coding practices and regularly audit code for security vulnerabilities.
- Conduct regular security assessments and penetration tests to identify and mitigate new vulnerabilities.

## 7. Conclusion
This security review identified several critical vulnerabilities in brights.sana.ai that could be exploited by malicious actors. It is recommended that immediate actions be taken to address these issues to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the application and its data.
